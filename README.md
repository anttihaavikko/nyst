# Hemlock Algorithm

Welcome to the Hemlock Algorith! Explore the world filled with puzzles and secrets.

I wanted to try out doing a 3D game in like first time ever if not counting some unfinished test projects. And dang, it is some much more complex with that one extra dimesion. Of course it's not just that extra dimension you need to worry about but also all the lighting stuff etc which is so much simpler in 2D. For me at least. But exploring a three dimensional space is really so much more interesting than in 2D where you pretty much see everything at a glance.

So having decided that I wanted to try out 3D and the theme being SECRETS, it was quite an obvious choice to go with an explorative puzzle solving game along the lines of Myst or Witness (for what I know about it never having actually played it) and escape rooms. Explore this small(ish) area collecting items and solving different kinds of puzzles and find your way out of there...
